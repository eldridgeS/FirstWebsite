# FirstWebsite
My first ever website made with ChatGPT.
I was inspired by a video on Youtube about how I could make a functional (and somewhat useful) website on ChatGPT very quickly so I decided to try and add on to it. 

Software used:
-VS Code
-Flask
-ChatGPT
-Youtube
-Google
-PythonAnywhere

Languages used:
-Python (main source code)
-HTML (index)
-Javascript

Challenges faced:
-Flask (used for developing web applications in Python) does not support Python 3.10+. It was quite challenging to navigate VS Code as everytime I tried downgrading my Python version it would change back to ver3.10.?, but I found that downloading from Microsoft Store is better than downloading from VS Code extensions.
-PythonAnywhere's directory differs from VS Code's directory so I could not directly transfer the code over. Hence, I had to figure out how to modify my code to properly access the directory on PythonAnywhere.

Notes:
-The code is surprisingly short and easy to write. Even the sound function that I added myself was very easy to add (though it doesn't work on mobile).
-I'm still exploring stuff in order to improve the website by adding more functions and learning HTML/CSS/Javascript along the way.
-There is both code I wrote initially in VS Code and modified (and upgraded) code I wrote on PythonAnywhere.
